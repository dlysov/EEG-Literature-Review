\begin{document}Epilepsy is a brain disorder in which a person has repeated seizures over time. Seizures are episodes that cause a disturbance in brain activity, which can cause changes in attention or behavior. Epilepsy is most commonly diagnosed through an EEG or a brain scan. An EEG records a patients brain waves that are detected by electrodes placed on the scalp. This is the most common way doctors can detect strange occurrences in the brain's electrical activity. People with epilepsy frequently have changes in their normal pattern of brain waves, even when they are not experiencing a seizure. Some unusual brain waves are generated deep in the brain where the EEG is unable to detect them. Many people who do not have epilepsy also show some unusual brain activity on an EEG. An EEG should be performed within 24 hours of a patient's first seizure. An EEG should also be performed while the patient is sleeping as well as when he or she is awake, because brain activity during sleep is often different than at other times. Two types of brain scans are CT and MRI scans. They reveal the structure of the brain, which can be useful for identifying brain tumors, cysts, and other abnormalities.

The most common method in treating epilepsy is through antiepileptic drugs. At the optimal dosage, these medication can control epileptic seizures. Another method in treating epilepsy is by using transcranial magnetic stimulation. This is a procedure that uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in the brain. This can be used to improve some of the symptoms of depression. However, transcranial magnetic stimulation can also be used to treat epilepsy. Although seizures in patients with epilepsy occasionally have been induced with single pulses, the multiple stimuli that can be created from TMS are more effective. This results in a more enriched research and better treatment results. Moreover, according to the American Epilepsy Society, TMS "...is simple to perform, relatively inexpensive, and generally safe, with the potential to provide noninvasive clinical measurements of neuronal excitability."

Identifying and learning about certain genes helps in epilepsy research. There are two general approaches in epilepsy research to linking errors of individual genes to all epileptic phenotypes. When taken together, these approaches have resulted in the identification of over 60 genes for epilepsy. Another approach to identifying genes for human epilepsy has so far revealed an equal number of genes linked to seizure disorders in mice. According to the article \underline{Exploring New Gene Discoveries in Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy}, "Instead of starting with a family with epilepsy and looking for the gene responsible, molecular biologists select genes of interest and, using experimental chromosomal engineering, delete or alter them in some way. They then construct a mouse model bearing this mutation and evaluate the neurological phenotype." This not only creates an animal model that can provide new knowledge on the biology of the gene, but it also generates gene candidates for human gene mapping. The Human Genome Project also contributes greatly to epilepsy research. An application of a computerized algorithm to evaluate all human gene sequences was used to compare them with sequence information from genes of known function was made by them.

Although there are many new methods arising for epilepsy research such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, majority of epilepsy research is directed toward genetics and phenotype-genotype studies. In the future these research projects aim to find a more concrete cure for epilepsy.
